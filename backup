# Results {#sec:results}

The performance of the proposed method of $k$ selection as well as the performance of other \noelia{xX} indices and the original \Rpackage{NbClust} approach are compared.
-->

<!--
The results are explained through the stadistical indicators: frequency, mean and standard deviation of the optimal k.
-->

<!--
The experiments are conducted in a \noelia{... caracterÃ­sticas del ordenador ...} and the programming language used was R with the development environment RStudio. All the code is available in the public Github repository \texttt{noeliarico/NbClust}. 

# Conclusions and future work {#results}

In this work, we have compared the performance of \noelia{xX} different clustering indices. Furthermore, we have proposed a new method to seek for the best number of clusters to divide a dataset.
